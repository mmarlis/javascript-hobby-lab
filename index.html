                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes
                   on a course in as few strokes as possible.</p>

                <p>Golf is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses
                   can be smaller, often having nine holes. Each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to
                   start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 &frac14; inches (11 cm) in
                   diameter. The game is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke
                   play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or
                   team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, but most
                   especially at the elite level.</p>
